# Reflection for GPS 1.1

**1. What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

I think the two areas I was a bit confused were.
	1. How to do deal with merge conflicts
	2. How checking out master, merging to master, and then re-checking out before pushing the feature branch worked

**2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

I think this helped both a bit.
	1. On 1 -- it looks like the key here is to get rid of the weird symbols, and work perhaps directly on master when resolving?
	2. On 2 -- it sounds like the reason for this is more with bigger teams, where pulling down a version of master that may have changed while working on the feature branch makes sense before pushing changes back up to Github

**3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

I asked asked a lot about (2), since the instructions in the Git workflow lesson had these in the steps as best practice. I just did not fully understand the rationale for that until now. 

**4. What still confuses you about git?**

Dealing with conflicts still scares me a bit.
As does figuring out how to undo history with revert / reset, but I feel like as more of those situations come up, we will laern how to deal with them.

**5. How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

Very good. I think it was very helpful to see other people's strengths and areas for opportunity. 
Was also helpful to have someone there who has been through this giving us advice on how best to work through stuff.
