# Reflection for GPS 1.1
**What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
Why merge conflicts happen and how to resolve them.

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
Merge conflicts were clarified by my peer and I when we tried to make changes to the same file (awesome_page.md) using two different branches (master and feature), as they failed to merge when doing so. You will then need to decide which changes of code you'd like to keep and delete everything else that is not needed.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
I didnt have too many questions in regards to the challenge itself but I did show my curiousity in trying/learning new things such as testing out moving files with 'mv' and using 'subl' in the command line to open a file in sublime. As the driver, I did ask for clarification on certain steps/commands.

**What still confuses you about git?**
I feel there are still so many commands and options in git that I have yet to experiment on, so i guess naturally, that alone confuses me about the extent of git and what more can be done within it.

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
It was great. It was comforting to go through a challenge and be on the same page with a peer, as well as receive insight and help from both my peer and guide.
